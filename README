## Sales Data Mining Project
Objective
The primary aim of this data mining project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of sales data to derive valuable insights into sales performance, identify emerging trends, and develop data-driven business strategies for improved decision-making.

**Dataset Overview and Data Preprocessing
The dataset includes comprehensive information on transactions, product details, and customer demographics essential for sales analysis. Before beginning the analysis, data preprocessing steps are performed to ensure high data quality. These steps include:

**Handling missing values
Removing duplicate records
Formatting data consistently across variables
Data preprocessing helps ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis process.

**SQL Queries for Analysis
To analyze the sales data effectively, a variety of SQL queries are employed to achieve the following:

**Data Aggregation: Summing sales data to analyze overall performance.
Key Performance Metrics Calculation: Calculating revenue, profit, and sales growth.
Dimensional Analysis: Grouping data by time, region, and product category for focused insights.
These queries also support the exploration of sales patterns, customer segmentation, and identification of top-performing products or regions, providing a foundation for strategic decision-making.
